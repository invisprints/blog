            "content": "Today, we are going to show you how to set up a literate programming environment, allowing you to use an IDE (VS Code) and an interactive computing environment (Jupyter), without leaving your browser, for free, in under 5 minutes. You’ll even see how VSCode and Jupyter work together automatically! But first, what is literate programming? And how did I go from skeptic to a zealot of literate programming? . Introduction . Literate programming is a programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated. According to Knuth, literate programming provides higher-quality programs by forcing programmers to explicitly state the thoughts behind the program. This process makes poorly thought-out design decisions more obvious. Knuth also claims that literate programming provides a first-rate documentation system, which is not an add-on, but is grown naturally in the process of exposition of one’s thoughts during a program’s creation. 1 . When I first learned about literate programming, I was quite skeptical. For the longest time, I had wrongly equated Jupyter notebooks with literate programming. Indeed, Jupyter is a brilliant interactive computing system, which was awarded the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Software System Award, and is loved by many developers. However, Jupyter falls short of the literate programming paradigm for the following reasons:2 . It can be difficult to compile source code from notebooks. | It can be difficult to diff and use version control with notebooks because they are not stored in plain text. | It is not clear how to automatically generate documentation from notebooks. | It is not clear how to properly run tests suites when writing code in notebooks. | . My skepticism quickly evaporated when I began using nbdev, a project that extends notebooks to complete the literate programming ideal. I spent a month, full time, using nbdev while contributing to the python library fastcore, and can report that Donald Knuth was definitely onto something. The process of writing prose and tests alongside code forced me to deeply understand why the code does what it does, and to think deeply about its design. Furthermore, the reduced cognitive load and speed of iteration of having documentation, code, and tests in one location boosted my productivity to levels I have never before experienced as a software developer. Furthermore, I found that developing this way bolstered collaboration such that code reviews not only happened faster but were more meaningful. In short, nbdev may be the most profound productivity tool I have ever used. . As a teaser, look how easy it is to instantiate this literate programming environment, which includes a notebook, a docs site and an IDE with all dependencies pre-installed! :point_down: . . Features of nbdev . As discussed in the docs, nbdev provides the following features: . Searchable, hyperlinked documentation, which can be automatically hosted on GitHub Pages for free. | Python modules, following best practices such as automatically defining __all__ with your exported functions, classes, and variables. | Pip and Conda installers. | Tests defined directly in notebooks which run in parallel. This testing system has been thoroughly tested with GitHub Actions. | Navigate and edit your code in a standard text editor or IDE, and export any changes automatically back into your notebooks. | . Since you are in a notebook, you can also add charts, text, links, images, videos, etc, that are included automatically in the documentation of your library, along with standardized documentation generated automatically from your code. This site is an example of docs generated automatically by nbdev. . GitHub Codespaces . Thanks to Conda and nbdev_template, setting up a development environment with nbdev is far easier than it used to be. However, we realized it could be even easier, thanks to a new GitHub product called Codespaces. Codespaces is a fully functional development environment in your browser, accessible directly from GitHub, that provides the following features: . A full VS Code IDE. | An environment that has files from the repository mounted into the environment, along with your GitHub credentials. | A development environment with dependencies pre-installed, backed by Docker. | The ability to serve additional applications on arbitrary ports. For nbdev, we serve a Jupyter notebook server as well as a Jekyll based documentation site. | A shared file system, which facilitates editing code in one browser tab and rendering the results in another. | … and more. | Codespaces enables developers to immediately participate in a project without wasting time on DevOps or complicated setup steps. Most importantly, CodeSpaces with nbdev allows developers to quickly get started with creating their own software with literate programming. . A demo of nbdev + Codespaces . This demo uses the project fastai/fastcore, which was built with nbdev, as an example. First, we can navigate to this repo and launch a Codespace: . . If you are launching a fresh Codespace, it may take several minutes to set up. Once the environment is ready, we can verify that all dependencies we want are installed (in this case fastcore and nbdev): . . Additionally, we can serve an arbitrary number of applications on user-specified ports, which we can open through VSCode as shown below: . . In this case, these applications are a notebook and docs site. Changes to a notebook are reflected immediately in the data docs. Furthermore, we can use the cli command nbdev_build_lib to sync our notebooks with python modules. This functionality is shown below: . . This is amazing! With a click of a button, I was able to: . Launch an IDE with all dependencies pre-installed. | Launch two additional applications: a Jupyter Notebook server on port 8080 and a docs site on port 4000. | Automatically update the docs and modules every time I make a change to a Jupyter notebook. | This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are additional utilities for writing and executing tests, diffing notebooks, special flags for hiding, showing, and collapsing cells in the generated docs, as well as git hooks for automation. This and more functionality is covered in the nbdev docs. . Give It A Try For Yourself . To try out nbdev yourself, take this tutorial, which will walk you through everything you need to know. The tutorial also shows you how to use a repository template with the configuration files necessary to enable Codespaces with nbdev. . You Can Write Blogs With Notebooks, Too! . This blog post was written in fastpages which is also built on nbdev! We recommend fastpages if you want an easy way to blog with Jupyter notebooks. . Additional Resources . The GitHub Codepaces site. | The official docs for Codespaces. | The nbdev docs. | The nbdev GitHub repo. | fastpages: The project used to write this blog. | The GitHub repo fastai/fastcore, which is what we used in this blog post as an example. | .

            "content": "subconverter . subconverter 是在各种订阅格式之间进行转换的实用程序 . 本文已更新到兼容 subconverter v0.6.4，更新日期 2020-11-08 . github 项目地址 . 公共 API . 常用案例 . 关于 subconverter 的用法在 readme 中已经给出详细的说明与部分简单用法了，本文将继续扩充一些 readme 中没有涉及到的 example。 . 云端运行 . readme 中介绍了大量本地运行的情况，但是对于众多用户来说我们并不希望在本地一直运行着 subconverter，我们希望有个云端 API。每当我们更新云端数据时，所有的更新就会自动 update 到我们的手机、电脑、路由器中，十分方便。 . 最简单的方法是使用公共 API，但有些人担心隐私机场泄漏问题，因此我们需要自己搭建一个云端转换器。 . Heroku 是一个在云端部署 web app 的平台，它托管于 Amazon 云且与 Github 深度集成。 subconverter 作者也提供了一键部署到 Herokuapp 的模版 heroku-subconverter，这里你可以一键部署到你的 Heroku 平台上，然后就可以使用 subconverter readme 中的简易用法。 . 但简易用法的链接通常十分冗长且难以记忆，在出现这种情况后，我们就需要利用 subconverter 提供的配置档案简化操作 . . step 1 既然需要用到配置档案，我们自然就不能使用 heroku 一键部署的功能（不然怎么添加本地文件？）。在heroku-subconverter页面，点击 use this template 将该模版 copy 自己的仓库下，这里建议将仓库权限设置为 Private，不然全世界人们都可以看见你的配置档案了。 . step 2 所有的配置档案都应保存在 base 文件夹中，因为 base 文件夹是软件运行的根目录。 . 修改 README.md 中的部署地址为 https://heroku.com/deploy?template=自己的仓库地址，这样在配置完成后点击 README 中 Deploy to Heroku 即可将服务部署在 Heroku 上。 . step 3 根据你的喜好在 base 中添加相应的配置档案。 配置档案参照subconverter 说明进行配置。 . . 建议在本地调试好后再上传云端。 step 4 在 Heroku 中关联 GitHub 的方法已经失效。每次修改完成后都需点击 Deploy to Heroku 将 Docker 部署到云端。 . step 5 至此部署云端 API 基本完成，这里有几个注意事项。 . 云端的根目录就是 base 目录。比如你在 base 下有一个example_profile.ini配置文件，路径就是https://***.herokuapp.com/getprofile?name=example_profile.ini&amp;token=*** | 需修改你在pref.ini的managed_config_prefix路径，将其指向云端路径 | 为了安全考虑，建议修改token默认密码 | 订阅时直接在订阅链接里输入云端 API 地址即可，如https://***.herokuapp.com/getprofile?name=example_profile.ini&amp;token=*** | 你可以建立多个配置文件，让不同软件使用不同配置文件。 | . 自定义规则 . 在 subconverter 说明文档中对自定义规则有少许描述，这里给出一个完整的自定义规则配置过程。 subconverter 的默认配置规则为神机规则，里面包含了大量与广告相关的规则。下面我们就以去除神机规则中的广告拦截规则为例。 . 在配置档案中，我们可以通过添加config参数加载额外的配置文件。当然我们也可以通过直接修改 pref.ini 实现。 . [Profile] target=clash url=ss://Y2hhY2hhMjAtaWV0Zi1wb2x5MTMwNTpwYXNzd29yZA@www.example.com:1080#Example ; 加载位于 config/example_external_config.ini 的配置文件 config=config/example_external_config.ini . 仿照默认的配置文件编辑自定义配置文件，默认配置文件在pref.ini由surge_ruleset和custom_proxy_group指出。 比如我们不想添加广告过滤。 .

            "content": "What Superpowers? . Hi, I’m Hamel Husain. I’m a machine learning engineer at GitHub. Recently, GitHub released a new product called GitHub Actions, which has mostly flown under the radar in the machine learning and data science community as just another continuous integration tool. . Recently, I’ve been able to use GitHub Actions to build some very unique tools for Data Scientists, which I want to share with you today. Most importantly, I hope to get you excited about GitHub Actions, and the promise it has for giving you new superpowers as a Data Scientist. Here are two projects I recently built with Actions that show off its potential: . fastpages . fastpages is an automated, open-source blogging platform with enhanced support for Jupyter notebooks. You save your notebooks, markdown, or Word docs into a directory on GitHub, and they automatically become blog posts. Read the announcement below: . We&#39;re launching `fastpages`, a platform which allows you to host a blog for free, with no ads. You can blog with @ProjectJupyter notebooks, @office Word, directly from @github&#39;s markdown editor, etc.Nothing to install, &amp; setup is automated!https://t.co/dNSA0oQUrN . &mdash; Jeremy Howard (@jeremyphoward) February 24, 2020 Machine Learning Ops . Wouldn’t it be cool if you could invoke a chatbot natively on GitHub to test your machine learning models on the infrastructure of your choice (GPUs), log all the results, and give you a rich report back in a pull request so that everyone could see the results? You can with GitHub Actions! . Consider the below annotated screenshot of this Pull Request: . . A more in-depth explanation about the above project can be viewed in this video: . Using GitHub Actions for machine learning workflows is starting to catch on. Julien Chaumond, CTO of Hugging Face, says: . GitHub Actions are great because they let us do CI on GPUs (as most of our users use the library on GPUs not on CPUs), on our own infra! 1 . Additionally, you can host a GitHub Action for other people so others can use parts of your workflow without having to re-create your steps. I provide examples of this below. . A Gentle Introduction To GitHub Actions . What Are GitHub Actions? . GitHub Actions allow you to run arbitrary code in response to events. Events are activities that happen on GitHub such as: . Opening a pull request | Making an issue comment | Labeling an issue | Creating a new branch | … and many more | . When an event is created, the GitHub Actions context is hydrated with a payload containing metadata for that event. Below is an example of a payload that is received when an issue is created: . { &quot;action&quot;: &quot;created&quot;, &quot;issue&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: 444500041, &quot;number&quot;: 1, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Spelling error in the README file&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: { &quot;login&quot;: &quot;Codertocat&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;User&quot;, }, &quot;labels&quot;: [ { &quot;id&quot;: 1362934389, &quot;node_id&quot;: &quot;MDU6TGFiZWwxMzYyOTM0Mzg5&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;bug&quot;, } ], &quot;body&quot;: &quot;It looks like you accidently spelled &#39;commit&#39; with two &#39;t&#39;s.&quot; } . This functionality allows you to respond to various events on GitHub in an automated way. In addition to this payload, GitHub Actions also provide a plethora of variables and environment variables that afford easy to access metadata such as the username and the owner of the repo. Additionally, other people can package useful functionality into an Action that other people can inherit. For example, consider the below Action that helps you publish python packages to PyPi: . The Usage section describes how this Action can be used: . - name: Publish a Python distribution to PyPI uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@master with: user: __token__ password: ${{ secrets.pypi_password }} . This Action expects two inputs: user and a password. You will notice that the password is referencing a variable called secrets, which is a variable that contains an encrypted secret that you can upload to your GitHub repository. There are thousands of Actions (that are free) for a wide variety of tasks that can be discovered on the GitHub Marketplace. The ability to inherit ready-made Actions in your workflow allows you to accomplish complex tasks without implementing all of the logic yourself. Some useful Actions for those getting started are: . actions/checkout: Allows you to quickly clone the contents of your repository into your environment, which you often want to do. This does a number of other things such as automatically mount your repository’s files into downstream Docker containers. | mxschmitt/action-tmate: Proivdes a way to debug Actions interactively. This uses port forwarding to give you a terminal in the browser that is connected to your Actions runner. Be careful not to expose sensitive information if you use this. | actions/github-script: Gives you a pre-authenticated ocotokit.js client that allows you to interact with the GitHub API to accomplish almost any task on GitHub automatically. Only these endpoints are supported (for example, the secrets endpoint is not in that list). | . In addition to the aforementioned Actions, it is helpful to go peruse the official GitHub Actions docs before diving in. . Example: A fastpages Action Workflow . The best to way familiarize yourself with Actions is by studying examples. Let’s take a look at the Action workflow that automates the build of fastpages (the platform used to write this blog post). . Part 1: Define Workflow Triggers . First, we define triggers in ci.yaml. Like all Actions workflows, this is a YAML file located in the .github/workflows directory of the GitHub repo. . The top of this YAML file looks like this: . name: CI on: push: branches: - master pull_request: . This means that this workflow is triggered on either a push or pull request event. Furthermore, push events are filtered such that only pushes to the master branch will trigger the workflow, whereas all pull requests will trigger this workflow. It is important to note that pull requests opened from forks will have read-only access to the base repository and cannot access any secrets for security reasons. The reason for defining the workflow in this way is we wanted to trigger the same workflow to test pull requests as well as build and deploy the website when a PR is merged into master. This will be clarified as we step through the rest of the YAML file. . Part 2: Define Jobs . Next, we define jobs (there is only one in this workflow). Per the docs: . A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs. Jobs run in parallel by default. . jobs: build-site: if: ( github.event.commits[0].message != &#39;Initial commit&#39; ) || github.run_number &gt; 1 runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: . The keyword build-site is the name of your job and you can name it whatever you want. In this case, we have a conditional if statement that dictates if this job should be run or not. We are trying to ensure that this workflow does not run when the first commit to a repo is made with the message ‘Initial commit’. The first variable in the if statement, github.event, contains a json payload of the event that triggered this workflow. When developing workflows, it is helpful to print this variable in order to inspect its structure, which you can accomplish with the following YAML: . - name: see payload run: | echo &quot;PAYLOAD: n${PAYLOAD} n&quot; env: PAYLOAD: ${{ toJSON(github.event) }} . Note: the above step is only for debugging and is not currently in the workflow. . toJson is a handy function that returns a pretty-printed JSON representation of the variable. The output is printed directly in the logs contained in the Actions tab of your repo. In this example, printing the payload for a push event will look like this (truncated for brevity): . { &quot;ref&quot;: &quot;refs/tags/simple-tag&quot;, &quot;before&quot;: &quot;6113728f27ae8c7b1a77c8d03f9ed6e0adf246&quot;, &quot;created&quot;: false, &quot;deleted&quot;: true, &quot;forced&quot;: false, &quot;base_ref&quot;: null, &quot;commits&quot;: [ { &quot;message&quot;: &quot;updated README.md&quot;, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;hamelsmu&quot; }, ], &quot;head_commit&quot;: null, } . Therefore, the variable github.event.commits[0].message will retrieve the first commit message in the array of commits. Since we are looking for situations where there is only one commit, this logic suffices. The second variable in the if statement, github.run_number is a special variable in Actions which: . [is a] unique number for each run of a particular workflow in a repository. This number begins at 1 for the workflow’s first run, and increments with each new run. This number does not change if you re-run the workflow run. . Therefore, the if statement introduced above: . if: ( github.event.commits[0].message != &#39;Initial commit&#39; ) || github.run_number &gt; 1 . Allows the workflow to run when the commit message is “Initial commit” as long as it is not the first commit. ( || is a logical or operator). . Finally, the line runs-on: ubuntu-latest specifies the host operating system that your workflows will run in. . Part 3: Define Steps . Per the docs: . A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps. Steps can run commands, run setup tasks, or run an Action in your repository, a public repository, or an Action published in a Docker registry. Not all steps run Actions, but all Actions run as a step. Each step runs in its own process in the runner environment and has access to the workspace and filesystem. Because steps run in their own process, changes to environment variables are not preserved between steps. GitHub provides built-in steps to set up and complete a job. . Below are the first two steps in our workflow: . - name: Copy Repository Contents uses: actions/checkout@master with: persist-credentials: false - name: convert notebooks and word docs to posts uses: ./_action_files . The first step creates a copy of your repository in the Actions file system, with the help of the utility action/checkout. This utility only fetches the last commit by default and saves files into a directory (whose path is stored in the environment variable GITHUB_WORKSPACE that is accessible by subsequent steps in your job. The second step runs the fastai/fastpages Action, which converts notebooks and word documents to blog posts automatically. In this case, the syntax: . uses: ./_action_files . is a special case where the pre-made GitHub Action we want to run happens to be defined in the same repo that runs this workflow. This syntax allows us to test changes to this pre-made Action when evaluating PRs by referencing the directory in the current repository that defines that pre-made Action. Note: Building pre-made Actions is beyond the scope of this tutorial. . The next three steps in our workflow are defined below: . - name: setup directories for Jekyll build run: | rm -rf _site sudo chmod -R 777 . - name: Jekyll build uses: docker://fastai/fastpages-jekyll with: args: bash -c &quot;gem install bundler &amp;&amp; jekyll build -V&quot; env: JEKYLL_ENV: &#39;production&#39; - name: copy CNAME file into _site if CNAME exists run: | sudo chmod -R 777 _site/ cp CNAME _site/ 2&gt;/dev/null || : . The step named setup directories for Jekyll build executes shell commands that remove the _site folder in order to get rid of stale files related to the page we want to build, as well as grant permissions to all the files in our repo to subsequent steps. . The step named Jekyll build executes a docker container hosted by the Jekyll community on Dockerhub called jekyll/jekyll. For those not familiar with Docker, see this tutorial. The name of this container is called fastai/fastpages-jekyll because I’m adding some additional dependencies to jekyll/jekyll and hosting those on my DockerHub account for faster build times2. The args parameter allows you to execute arbitrary commands with the Docker container by overriding the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile. We use this Docker container hosted on Dockerhub so we don’t have to deal with installing and configuring all of the complicated dependencies for Jekyll. The files from our repo are already available in the Actions runtime due to the first step in this workflow, and are mounted into this Docker container automatically for us. In this case, we are running the command jekyll build, which builds our website and places relevant assets them into the _site folder. For more information about Jekyll, read the official docs. Finally, the env parameter allows me to pass an environment variable into the Docker container. . The final command above copies a CNAME file into the _site folder, which we need for the custom domain https://fastpages.fast.ai. Setting up custom domains are outside the scope of this article. . The final step in our workflow is defined below: . - name: Deploy if: github.event_name == &#39;push&#39; uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: deploy_key: ${{ secrets.SSH_DEPLOY_KEY }} publish_dir: ./_site . The statement . if: github.event_name == &#39;push&#39; . uses the variable github.event_name to ensure this step only runs when a push event ( in this case only pushes to the master branch trigger this workflow) occur. . This step deploys the fastpages website by copying the contents of the _site folder to the root of the gh-pages branch, which GitHub Pages uses for hosting. This step uses the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages Action, pinned at version 3. Their README describes various options and inputs for this Action. . Conclusion . We hope that this has shed some light on how we use GitHub Actions to automate fastpages. While we only covered one workflow above, we hope this provides enough intuition to understand the other workflows in fastpages. We have only scratched the surface of GitHub Actions in this blog post, but we provide other materials below for those who want to dive in deeper.

You can follow the steps in this blog post, which walk you through how to use pandoc to do the conversion. Note: If you wish to customize your Word generated blog post in markdown, make sure you delete your Word document from the _word directory so your markdown file doesn’t get overwritten! . If your primary method of writing blog posts is Word documents, and you plan on always manually editing Word generated markdown files, you are probably better off using fast_template instead of fastpages. . The material below is a reproduction of this blog post, and serves as an illustrative example. . Maintaining a healthy open source project can entail a huge amount of toil. Popular projects often have orders of magnitude more users and episodic contributors opening issues and PRs than core maintainers capable of handling these issues. . Consider this graphic prepared by the NumFOCUS foundation showing the number of maintainers for three widely used scientific computing projects: . . We can see that across these three projects, there is a very low ratio maintainers to users. Fixing this problem is not an easy task and likely requires innovative solutions to address the economics as well as tools. . Due to its recent momentum and popularity, Kubeflow suffers from a similar fate as illustrated by the growth of new issues opened: . . Source: “TensorFlow World 2019, Automating Your Developer Workflow With ML” . Coincidentally, while building out end to end machine learning examples for Kubeflow, we built two examples using publicly available GitHub data: GitHub Issue Summarization and Code Search. While these tutorials were useful for demonstrating components of Kubeflow, we realized that we could take this a step further and build concrete data products that reduce toil for maintainers. . This is why we started the project kubeflow/code-intelligence, with the goals of increasing project velocity and health using data driven tools. Below are two projects we are currently experimenting with : . Issue Label Bot: This is a bot that automatically labels GitHub issues using Machine Learning. This bot is a GitHub App that was originally built for Kubeflow but is now also used by several large open source projects. The current version of this bot only applies a very limited set of labels, however we are currently A/B testing new models that allow personalized labels. Here is a blog post discussing this project in more detail. . | Issue Triage GitHub Action: to compliment the Issue Label Bot, we created a GitHub Action that automatically adds / removes Issues to the Kubeflow project board tracking issues needing triage. . | Together these projects allow us to reduce the toil of triaging issues. The GitHub Action makes it much easier for the Kubeflow maintainers to track issues needing triage. With the label bot we have taken the first steps in using ML to replace human intervention. We plan on using features extracted by ML to automate more steps in the triage process to further reduce toil. . Building Solutions with GitHub Actions . One of the premises of Kubeflow is that a barrier to building data driven, ML powered solutions is getting models into production and integrated into a solution. In the case of building models to improve OSS project health, that often means integrating with GitHub where the project is hosted. . We are really excited by GitHub’s newly released feature GitHub Actions because we think it will make integrating ML with GitHub much easier. . For simple scripts, like the issue triage script, GitHub actions make it easy to automate executing the script in response to GitHub events without having to build and host a GitHub app. . To automate adding/removing issues needing triage to a Kanban board we wrote a simple python script that interfaces with GitHub’s GraphQL API to modify issues. . As we continue to iterate on ML Models to further reduce toil, GitHub Actions will make it easy to leverage Kubeflow to put our models into production faster. A number of prebuilt GitHub Actions make it easy to create Kubernetes resources in response to GitHub events. For example, we have created GitHub Actions to launch Argo Workflows. This means once we have a Kubernetes job or workflow to perform inference we can easily integrate the model with GitHub and have the full power of Kubeflow and Kubernetes (eg. GPUs). We expect this will allow us to iterate much faster compared to building and maintaining GitHub Apps. . Call To Action . We have a lot more work to do in order to achieve our goal of reducing the amount of toil involved in maintaining OSS projects. If your interested in helping out here’s a couple of issues to get started: . Help us create reports that pull and visualize key performance indicators (KPI). https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence/issues/71 . We have defined our KPI here: issue #19 | . | Combine repo specific and non-repo specific label predictions: https://github.com/kubeflow/code-intelligence/issues/70 . | . In addition to the aforementioned issues we welcome contributions for these other issues in our repo. .",

DOSBox . Windows 下著名的 DOS 模拟器，华中科技大学自动化学生御用 DOS 模拟器，其官网已经多年没有更新了，所以对于最新的系统可能有一些兼容问题。 最新的版本是 2010 年推出的 0.74 版，之后就再也没有更新。细心的读者可能会发现，DOSBox 居然有 MAC OS X 版！各位，先别急着欢呼，我这里之所以用 MAC OS X 而没用 macOS 就是想提醒大家这个版本已经很老了，最新版的兼容性堪忧。 所以广大的 macOS 该怎么办呢？大家放心，既然我博文都写出来了，肯定有比装虚拟机更好的方法。 . ##Boxer 就是我们大名鼎鼎的 Boxer！虽然最新更新日期是 2016 年 2 月，快有一年没有更新了，但是相比于 DOSBox， 已经好太多。官网地址 软件本身自带几个 DOS 游戏，大家可以试着玩玩，但是我们今天的主题不是这个，而是用它进行汇编语言实验。 . ###搭建环境 有了著名的 DOS 操作环境，下面我们需要搭建开发环境，毕竟 Boxer 本身是不包含编译汇编程序的。 这是我找的一份 DOS 环境下汇编语言开发包，提取码是 je38。至于从哪找的我已经忘了，反正好用无毒！ 下载好后把里面的程序放到你的汇编语言开发环境中，即在同一个目录下。 . ###挂载项目 打开 Boxer 后选择 Open a DOS prompt, 即进入的我们熟悉又和蔼的 DOS 操作环境。但是我们目前处于一个神奇的位置—— Z 盘！Z 盘是在哪里呢？抱歉我也不知道，也不想知道。 . 我们目前要做的就是定位到我们的项目文件夹。方法很简单，也有多种，这里我介绍最方便的一种，其他的读者可以自己探索。 把你的项目文件夹直接拖动到 Boxer 窗口中，Boxer会把你拖动的文件夹当成 C 盘挂载。 挂载成功后，就是这样的！ 输入 dir 我们可以浏览当前文件夹下都有哪些文件。 . ###编译并运行程序 编译文件用 masm 命令，如： . masm example.asm . 编译成功后会生成 .obj 文件，用命令 link 链接对应的文件生成可执行文件，如： . link example.obj . 运行生成的 .exe 文件即可！ .",

            "content": "大津算法（OTSU） . 在图像处理领域，我们会遇到如下需求：把图像中的目标物体和背景分开。比如背景用白色表示，目标物体用黑色表示。此时我们知道目标物体的灰度值相互接近，背景灰度值相互接近，那么用大津算法能很好把目标从背景当中区分开来。 . 算法思想 . 目标 . 比如对于下面这张灰度图片 目标物体是中间黑色的几何物体，我们想让这些物体和背景区分更明显一些，比如让物体为纯黑，背景全白。那么我们就需要找到一个合适的阈值，使图片上灰度值大于这个阈值的像素点为255（白色），灰度值小于阈值的像素点为0（黑色）。也就是变成下面这幅图： 那么大津算法需要处理的就是找到最佳的阈值，让目标和物体尽可能分离开。 . 灰度直方图 . 为了找到合适的阈值，我们首先观察原图的灰度直方图📊： 这是用 Matlab 对原图形成的灰度直方图，灰度直方图的含义是统计图像中不同灰度值的分布情况。由图我们可以看出两个尖峰，在灰度值为0～20的地方存在一个尖峰，代表原图中有大量像素点灰度值为0～20，经观察我们可以认为这部分对应于目标物体。同理我们可以看出背景的灰度值大多集中于100～140之间，为了让目标和背景区分更加明显，我们想让目标物体的灰度值全为0，背景的灰度值全为255，这种处理手法也称为二值化法。 . 那么阈值取多少合适呢？从图上看似乎取50～100中的任意一点都可以，但是实际情况并不想参考图那样明显，有些图片背景和目标物体较为接近，我们需要一个算法来找到最优阈值才行。 . 聚类 . 首先我们思考什么样的东西才能成为一类，而我们又是怎么分类的。对于参考图来说，我们可以认为灰度值接近的为一类，灰度值不接近的不是同一类。那我们又是如何衡量灰度值接近的程度呢？这里面就需要用到方差的概念。 方差相比大家都了解，同一类的物体方差小，不同类的物体方差大。所以对于此图我们希望分类的结果是对于灰度值相近的同一类物体，它的方差最小，称为类内方差最小。灰度值不接近的不同类物体，它的方差大，称为类间方差最大。 . 步骤 . 所以步骤总结如下： 首先我们要形成参考图的灰度直方图，这样方便我们找到最佳阈值。 接下来我们通过穷举每一个灰度值，计算以此为阈值的类内和类间方差。 找到能形成类内方差最小的或类间方差最大的阈值，这个就是我们要找的最佳阈值。 . 算法 . 下面以两类分割讲解下具体的算法，实际上大津算法可以分割多类出来。 . 我们定义$ delta_i^2 $为第 i 类的类内方差，$ delta_w^2 $为类内方差和，$ delta_b^2 $为类间方差和；$ omega_i$为第 i 类的概率分布，t 为当前假设的阈值，p(i) 为灰度值为 i 的概率密度。则对于 2 类问题： ω1(t)=∑0tp(i)δw2(t)=∑i=1i=2ωi(t)δi2 omega_1(t)= sum_0^t p(i) delta_w^2(t)= sum _{i=1}^{i=2} omega_i(t) delta_i^2ω1​(t)=∑0t​p(i)δw2​(t)=∑i=1i=2​ωi​(t)δi2​ 而最小化类内方差和最大化类间方差是相同的，即 δb2(t)=δ2−δw2=ω1(t)ω2(t)[μ1(t)−μ2(t)]2 delta_b^2(t)= delta^2- delta_w^2= omega_1(t) omega_2(t)[ mu_1(t)- mu_2(t)]^2δb2​(t)=δ2−δw2​=ω1​(t)ω2​(t)[μ1​(t)−μ2​(t)]2 类均值$ mu_1(t)$： μ1(t)=[∑0tp(i)∗i]/ω1 mu_1(t)=[ sum_0^t p(i)*i]/ omega_1μ1​(t)=[∑0t​p(i)∗i]/ω1​ . 遍历 t 所有的可能值，找到最小$ delta_w^2$或最大$ delta_b^2$所对应的 t 值，就是我们的最佳阈值。 . 代码实现 . C语言实现 . /* OTSU 算法 * *src 存储灰度图像，width 图像宽，height 图像长 * 返回最佳阈值 */ int otsu(const int *src, int width, int height) { int histogram[256]; //存储灰度直方图，这里为256色灰度 int t,thred; float wf,wb,ub,uf,curVal,maxVal; int sumb=0,sumf=0,sumW=0,sumPixel=width*height; wb=wf=maxVal=0.0f; //求灰度直方图 memset(histogram,0,sizeof(histogram)); for(i=0;i&lt;width*height;i++) { histogram[src[i]]++; } for (i=0;i&lt;256;i++) sumW+=i*histogram[i]; //枚举每个灰度 for(t=0;t&lt;256;t++) { //求两类类概率密度 wb+=histogram[t]; wf=sumPixel-wb; if (wb==0||wf==0) continue; //求类均值 sumb+=i*histogram[t]; sumf=sumW-sumb; ub=sumb/wb; uf=sumf/wf; //求当前类间方差 curVal=wb*wf*(ub-uf)*(ub-uf); if(curVal&gt;maxVal) { thred=t; maxVal=curVal; } } return thred; } .",

            "content": "macOS 下根据当前应用自动修改快捷键 . 自从习惯了 iPad 外接键盘的快捷键，越发觉得 Caps Lock 进行中英文切换十分方便。但是作为多年的标准 Vim 党，把 Caps Lock 键映射成 ctrl(or esc) 键又是理所应当的事情。人民日益增长的美好需求和不平等不充分的系统功能发展的矛盾已经成为当今 Vimer 的主要矛盾👀。 . ##基本设置 先说说在察觉的 Caps Lock 方便的中英文切换之前我是怎么做的。利用系统自带的设置可以很方便地把 Caps Lock 键映射成你想要的其他修饰键 1 。 . ###方法 . 打开系统偏好设置。 | 点击键盘选项。 . | 在键盘标签页中点击右下角的修饰键。 | 将左边的键根据自己的需求重新映射成其他的修饰键吧。图中我把 Caps Lock 键重新映射成 Ctrl 键。 | ##新的矛盾 面临新的主要矛盾，最好的方法是去解决它而不是逃避它！经过我多年深入探索尝试，终于！！！！！ 就决定是你了！出来吧！皮卡丘！ 这位皮卡丘就是我们大名鼎鼎的 Karabiner-Elements。 先奉上深藏功与名的官方网页 . 这网页设计的清晰脱俗，比花花绿绿的 vim 官网直白多了。 . Karabiner-Elements . Karabiner-Elements 是大名鼎鼎的键盘自定义软件 Karabiner 后续之作，经过完全重新设计，性能得到大副优化，专门针对 macOS 10.12 和后面的更高峰！！2 . 由于这个软件笔者也不是太熟悉，所以这里就讲讲专门针对 vim 的基础设置吧，其他的靠官网介绍和各位读者的想象力了。 . ###简单配置方法 像这种系统辅助类软件基本都没有什么好看的界面的，一般都是在偏好设置填满密密麻麻的配置选项。所以我们先打开软件的偏好设置。 我的方法是添加了一个新的配置文件，这个配置文件专门针对 Vim 快捷键。编辑配置文件在 Profiles 标签页。这软件没有中文，所以你如果英语不好的话建议早点放弃 Vim 吧。孩子，永生的 Vim 不是你能掌握的！！ 就叫 VimMode！这名字听起来既装逼又不失一些细节，读者也可以按照自己的喜好来。 创建好配置文件后选中它，我们就进入了 VimMode 的设置中，然后作为该软件的一枚萌新🐶，我们就去 Simple Modification 标签页看看吧。 . 通过一些骚操作，我们把 caps_lock 键映射成 ctrl 键了，就下来，就可以愉快的玩耍了！在平时就用默认配置，vim 下就切换成 VimMode。 . ##人是贪得无厌的。。。 作为华科大自动化的人，怎么能忍手动切换这两种模式呢？一定要自动化！！！！ 经过无数个漫长的春夏秋冬，潮涨潮落，终于在一个月黑风高的夜晚，笔者的苦心感动了上天，于是晚上周公约笔者，说：“骚年，看你骨骼惊奇，不如我送你一部xx宝典吧！”笔者定眼一看，一个大大的 Command 键 Logo 赫然印出现在眼前，不错，就是这个东西！Keyboard Maestro!! . 作为 macOS 上最强大的自动化工具之一，多次让笔者产生了放弃 Alfred 的念头，最终笔者还是忍住了，因为没有时间学这个软件怎么用。 . ###自动切换 VimMode 切换两种配置文件就是修改 Karabiner-Elements 的配置文件，经专案组调查发现，这个隐秘的窝点在 . /Users/`whoami`/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json . 只需把文件中 “profiles” 下的 “name” 后的内容修改成相应的文件名即可。 我们可以写个脚本来修改后面的字符串，平常就是 “Default profile”，遇到特殊情况就修改成其他的，比如说 VimMode。 Keyboard Maestro 可以检测你当前用的软件，从而自动触发一些命令，我们可以利用这个特点，让 Keyboard Maestro 根据当前使用的软件自动激活指定脚本，从而修改 Karabiner-Elements 的配置文件。 . 这里直接拿了 Donie Leigh 的脚本做 demo，在此表示十分感谢！！！ 一键切换脚本访问地址 . 将这个脚本放到你喜欢的地方，比如我就放到了跟作案窝点相同的位置，然后打开 Keyboard Maestro 进行如下的配置： 嗯，就是这样，多的不需要解释了吧，当 Clion 或 Vim 处于激活状态时触发脚本。如果看不懂请到评论区留言，不过我估计应该不会有多少人看就是了😒😒 不过不要忘记了，有进就又出😏！当退出这两个软件时（或切换到别的软件时）我们要修改回默认配置，这个很简单，只需对着这个稍稍修改下就可以了，不懂请到评论区留言！！ . 接下来使用就很舒服了，自动切换，美滋滋！ . 据我观察，macOS 上修饰键指的是 Caps Lock, Ctrl, Option, Cmd, Esc 这五个键。 &#8617; . | 其实是原来的不兼容新系统，作者又懒得让软件适配这么多版本的系统，干脆重新开发个软件，老软件针对老系统，新软件针对新系统，省事！ &#8617; . |",

            "content": "最小错误率贝叶斯决策 . 在一般的模式识别问题中，人们往往希望尽量减少分类的错误，即目标是追求最小的错误率。其中利用概率论中贝叶斯公式得到的分类决策被称之为最小错误率贝叶斯决策。 . . ##问题引入 在某个地区中人们常对细胞中某一种物质（特征观察值）进行检测，来判定它是否是正常细胞。通常情况下这种细胞是正常（w1 类）的可能性是0.9，是异常（w2 类）的可能性是0.1。现在有一种待观察的细胞，其特征观察值是 x。根据以往的结果，正常（w1 类）细胞中其特征观察值是 x 的可能性是0.2；异常（w2 类）细胞中其特征观察值是 x 的可能性是0.4。试判断该细胞是正常还是异常。 . ##分析 我们的目标是让我们出现错误的概率尽可能的低，也就是所谓的最小错误率[^wrong rate] 准则。 . 那么我们如何才能实现最小错误率？试想一下如果我们只知道这个细胞是正常的可能性有0.9，异常的可能性有0.1。那么我们会认为这是正常细胞，因为我们判断失误的概率只有0.1。相对于其他判断结果（认为这是异常细胞），我们实现了最小错误率。 . 事实上，上面说的 0.1 和 0.9 是在没有对样本进行任何观察情况下得到的概率，因此我们称它为先验概率。 . 现在我们观察细胞，知道它的特征值为 x，我们需要求在已知 x 的情况下细胞属于各类的概率，用 $P( omega _{i}|x)$ 表示，相信学过条件概率的都清楚这个意思。这种概率也称为后验概率。 所以对于两类问题，我们的决策思想是谁的后验概率大，我们就认为它属于哪类。 P(ω1∣x)&gt;&lt;P(ω2∣x),x∈{ω1ω2P( omega _{1}|x) begin{matrix}&gt; &lt; end{matrix}P( omega _{2}|x), x in begin{cases} omega _{1} omega _{2} end{cases}P(ω1​∣x)&gt;&lt;​P(ω2​∣x),x∈{ω1​ω2​​ . 那么怎么求后验概率呢？我们知道后验概率 $P( omega _{i} | x)$ 换一种求法是先求特征值是 x 且 属于 $ omega _{i}$ 类的概率 $p(x, omega _{i})$，也称为联合概率密度。再除以特征值是 x 的概率 p(x)，称为总体密度。而联合概率密度则是由类条件密度 $p( omega _{i} | x)$ 乘以先验概率 $P( omega _{i} | x)$ 得到。所以我们就得到经典的贝叶斯公式： | . P(ωi∣x)=p(x,ωi)p(x)=p(x∣ωi)P(ωi)p(x)=p(x∣ωi)P(ωi)∑j=1np(x∣ωj)P(ωj)P( omega _{i}|x)= frac{p(x, omega _{i})}{p(x)}= frac{p(x| omega _{i})P( omega _{i})}{p(x)}= frac{p(x| omega _{i})P( omega _{i})}{ sum_{j=1}^{n}p(x| omega _{j})P( omega _{j})}P(ωi​∣x)=p(x)p(x,ωi​)​=p(x)p(x∣ωi​)P(ωi​)​=∑j=1n​p(x∣ωj​)P(ωj​)p(x∣ωi​)P(ωi​)​ . 所以在问题引入中，我们只需求出 w1 和 w2 的后验概率，比较它们的大小即可1。 . ##未完待续 接下来还会介绍似然比，并用图形进一步解释贝叶斯决策，但最近学业繁忙，可能最近一段时间不会更新了。 . 此题答案是把 x 归于正常细胞。 &#8617; . |",

VPN Azure 功能是真正实现内网穿透了的，最牛逼的在于他免费！！缺点是只支持 SSTP 协议，苹果家族的就很难使用了。iOS 端目前是不行的，macOS 上可以用 sstp-client 命令行工具或 isstp 图形界面来连接。 sstp-client: . brew install sstp-client . isstp 下载地址 . 默认的 VPN 服务器搭建好后只能使用 SoftEther VPN Client 连接，如果要让 iOS 等移动端连接的话，需要打开 IPsec / L2TP 设置。 . 另外如果要远程连接需要在管理用户选项中添加用户，这里面功能还是蛮强的。 . 如果想让 iOS 设备登录处于内网中的 VPN 服务器，可以试试神器 frp。我稍后会出一篇博文将如何使用 frp 访问内网 VPN 服务器。 .",

            "content": "Vim 折叠 . 作为编辑器之神，Vim 怎么可能没有代码折叠功能呢？但是 Vim 的上手难度极高，想要有顺手的折叠功能可不是一件易事。 . . 目前版本参考官方文档，后面会逐渐加上自己的探索。 . Vim 折叠方式 . Vim 有 6 种折叠方式： . manual //手工定义折叠 | indent //用缩进表示折叠 | expr　 //用表达式来定义折叠 | syntax //用语法高亮来定义折叠 | diff //对没有更改的文本进行折叠 | marker //用标志折叠 | 手动折叠 . 通过手动告诉 Vim 哪些代码块需要折叠来实现功能。 在 vimrc 中添加如下配置： . set foldmethod = manual . 试一试: 把光标置于某一段落内，并键入: . zfap . 你将会看到该段落被一行高亮的文本所代替。你已经创建一个折叠了。 zf 是个操作 符，而 ap 是一个文本对象。你可以将 zf 操作符跟任何一个移动命令联用，为所经之处的文本创建一个折叠。 zf 也能在可视模式下使用。 . 若要再阅读那些文本，可以键入以下命令以打开该折叠: . zo . 你还可以用以下命令再关闭该折叠: . zc . 所有的折叠命令都以 z 开头。展开你的想像力，这个字母看起来就像一张折叠起来的 纸的侧面。而 “z” 后面可用的字母，由于采用了帮助记忆方法选择，很容易记得住: . zf F-old creation (创建折叠) zo O-pen a fold (打开折叠) zc C-lose a fold (关闭折叠) . 折叠可以嵌套: 一个含有折叠的文本区可以被再次折叠。例如，你可以折叠本节内每一段 落，然后折叠本章内所有的节。试试看。你将注意到，打开全章的折叠，会将节的折叠还 原得跟以前一样，有些打开，而有些关闭。 . 假定你已经创建了若干折叠，而现在需要阅览全部文本。你可以移到每个折叠处，并键入 “zo”。若要做得更快，可以用这个命令: . zr . 这将减少 (R-educe) 折叠。相反的操作是: . zm . 这将折叠更多 (M-ore)。你可以重复 “zr” 和 “zm” 来打开和关闭若干层嵌套的折叠。 . 如果你有一个嵌套了好几层深的折叠，你可以用这个命令把它们全部打开: . zR . 这将减少折叠直至一个也不剩。而用下面这个命令你可以关闭所有的折叠: . zM . 这将增加折叠，直至所有的折叠都关闭了。 . 缩进折叠 . Vim 通过文本的缩进来自动添加折叠，适用于 Python 和大纲。 在 vimrc 中添加如下配置： . set foldmethod = indent . 然后你可以用 zm 和 zr 命令增加和减少折叠。在下面这个例文上很容易看明白: . 本行没有缩进 本行被缩进一次 本行被缩进两次 本行被缩进两次 本行被缩进一次 本行没有缩进 本行被缩进一次 本行被缩进一次 . 注意 缩进多少和折叠深度之间的关系倚赖于 shiftwidth 选项。每个 shiftwidth 选项规定的缩进宽度，在折叠深度上加一。这被称为一个折叠级别。 . 当你使用 zr 和 zm 命令时，你实际上是在增加或减少 foldlevel 选项。你也可以直接设置它: . :set foldlevel=3 . 这意味着，所有缩进等于或大于 shiftwidth 三倍的折叠将被关闭。折叠级别设定得越 低，越多的折叠将被关闭。当 foldlevel 为零时，所有的折叠都将被关闭。 zM 把 foldlevel 设为零。相反的命令 zR 把 foldlevel 设为文件中最深的折叠级别。 . 因此，有两种方法开启和关闭折叠: . 设定折叠级别。 这提供了一种极快的 “缩小” 方法来查看文本结构，移动光标，以及重新 “放大” 到具体的文本。 . | 利用 zo 和 zc 命令打开和关闭指定的折叠。 这个方法允许你仅仅打开那些你要打开的折叠，而不影响其它的折叠。 . | . 这两种方法可以结合起来用: 你可以先用几次 zm 以关闭大多数折叠，然后用 zo 打开一个指定的折叠。或者，用 zR 打开所有的折叠，然后用 zc 关闭指定的折叠。 . 但是，当折叠方法 foldmethod 的值为 indent 时，你不能手动定义折叠。因为那样 会引起缩进宽度和折叠级别之间的冲突。 . 标志折叠 . Vim 通过事先添加的标志折叠代码块。 在 vimrc 中添加如下配置： . set foldmethod = marker . 语法折叠 . Vim 为每一种不同的语言使用一个不同的语法文件。语法文件为文件中各种不同语法项定义颜色。在语法文件中，你可以加入一些带有 “fold” 参数的语法项。这些语法项将定义折叠。 在 vimrc 中添加如下配置： . set foldmethod = syntax . zc 关闭折叠 zo 打开折叠 za 打开/关闭折叠互相切换 . 关闭 Vim 默认折叠 . 当我们选好自动折叠后，打开代码是就会发现 vim 默认把所有代码都折叠了，如果不想要这个选项，可以在 vimrc 添加如下配置关闭默认折叠： . set foldlevelstart=99 . 折叠插件 . vim 默认的折叠配置并不容易上手，对于 C++ 项目来说，vim 自带的语法折叠太过简单，很多地方都不能折叠，而我目前又不想去修改 cpp.vim 语法文件，经过大量搜索，终于找了一个增强版的折叠插件。 . 插件地址：GitHub 主页 . 安装 . 在 .vimrc 合适位置添加如下代码（Vundle 安装）： . Plugin &#39;LucHermitte/VimFold4C&#39; . 输入 . :PluginInstall . 等待安装完成。 . 使用 . 跟默认的一致，如果想要进阶，可以去项目主页看看。 .",

            "content": "《自控力是训练出来的》 . 这是一本可以超快速阅读的书，是一本可以当做查阅手册和行动指南的书。 . . 题外话 . 无聊时看了看室友书架上的书，这种精心包装又符合当代社会的书自然吸引了我的目光，简单看下来，这本书有惊喜之处也有让人失望的地方。 这本书并不是那本很出名的《自控力》，我刚开始也被骗了，等我发现时书已经读了一大半，想想还是读完吧。 . 概述 . 本书以“自控力”为中心，配上关键字“训练”，构成整本书。通过一系列吸引人眼球的“风靡哈佛、耶鲁、斯坦福”，“决定人生命运的关键力量”和“职场精英成功掌控xxxx”的标题，告诉读者此书非同小可。理论洗脑 + 名言警句 + 训练手册 + 成功案例，全书架构清晰，思路流畅，层层递进，可以说是一本不错的畅销书。 . 结构 . 其实在概述部分已经点出本书的结构了，这本书的结构可以从两个方向来看，第一个方向从目录直接就可以看出，理论洗脑 + 名言警句 + 训练手册 + 成功案例，很简单的平铺结构。另一种要看完了才知道，是 why how what 结构。书从“为什么要训练自控力？”-&gt;“自控力怎样训练？”-&gt;“训练内容是什么？”层层递进，铺展开来构成全书。 . 内容 . 浅显易懂是这本书的最大优点，畅销书要做到畅销首先必须是语言简单，其实看完这本书后我意外发现这是本很不错的营销优秀范本。语言简单是这本书首要特点，以“风靡”、“哈佛、耶鲁、斯坦福”、“决定人生命运”、“精英”这些吸引人的词语放在标题，充分吸引读者。抓住当代人所缺乏的自控力，可以说找到一个很好的切入口。配以训练标题，在目前知识付费这个风口上可以说是恰如其分。简单翻翻书，书中说有重点都自动标注出来，稍稍看下，语言简单，训练轻松，给人一种10周就可以登上人生巅峰的感觉。不可否认，这是本典型的营销书籍。 书的内容还是可圈可点的，每一句话都说的很有道理，考虑了现代人渴望速成和零碎时间的现状，很有针对性得提出计划。首先语言简单，这样阅读速度就可以很快，迅速把前面理论篇章看过去，顺便给读者打了一剂鸡血，而在在理论篇章配以大量警句，都是可以马上行动的语言，给渴望速成的人提供建议。而后面的训练计划一个是10周，另一个是每个训练花费不了多少时间，这样就很符合当代人的生活节奏，能在短时间内有效果，而且并不影响当前的生活节奏，可以说是十分完美的训练手册。 虽然说很多人在经历了知识付费的浪潮后很反感这种“速成”的课程，因而对我上面推荐理由不以为然，但是他们并没有认识到当前这个社会的一些现状和个人成长的局限性。首先快节奏和时间碎片化是这个时代不能改变的东西，你如果想花大把大把的时间用在培训上，那只能脱离当前社会，隐居山林，这对大部分人来说是明显不可取的。其次是人在训练过程中是需要变化来鼓励自己的，一个很长时间看不到成果的训练或计划是难以维持下去的，因此才会有速成课程的兴起。所以我们既要认清当前的现状，同时又清楚速成只是一时，我们还需要长期训练加以配合，才能真正起到我们想达到的效果。 . 缺点 . 讲述方式是这本训练手册最大的败笔。书中大堆罗列名言警句，明显就不是想让我们一条条看下去的，只能当做本字典来查询，后面的训练部分也有这个问题。在“自控力与心智训练”的章节中，竟然大堆罗列枯燥无味的方法，太让我感到意外，值得欣慰的是第三章以后恢复了正常，具有一个训练手册该有的样子，不过语言过于平淡，难以让人激发想训练的冲动。 如果是我来写这本书的话，我肯定模仿市面上流行的记忆力训练手册来写，这样的话我相信训练意义更大。 . 其他 . 既然书看错了，那我以后肯定会补《自控力》这本书的，不过目前手上只有电子版，等开学的时候再看看吧。 .",

            "content": "《金字塔思维 - 现代人精神健康之道》 . 这是近年来我读过的最好的书，这是一本可遇不可求的书。 . . ##题外话 说来也巧，这本2000年的旧书是我在图书馆闲逛时无意发现的，当时只是打算消磨消磨时间，没想到看了一小段后根本刹不住车！比起之前看了又放弃的一大堆哲学入门书和什么现代生存法则，这本书不知道比它们高到哪里去了。 . 概述 . 正如书中前言所言，《金字塔思维》这本书“想提供给读者的是一种健康的思维方法”，告诉人们在现代社会应该如何看待各种社会现象和社会纷争，怎样在这个高速发展的社会寻找自身的价值和意义。书中以超级生动形象的言语启发人们如何把握生活节奏，如何形成积极向上的人生观价值观，可以当做大多数人的哲学启蒙书。相比于另一本哲学启蒙书——《中国哲学简史》，我认为本书更加通俗易懂，而且对现实的指导意义更大。 . 结构 . 我认为每个领域的入门书都应该是自顶向下设计的。先宏观再微观，有大方向到具体细节，这样看下来我才知道自己学了什么东西，可以用在什么方向。而不是像现在的主流教科书一样，自以为以小见大，从一个突破口突破。结果是学生学了半天不知道可以应用到哪个方向上，只会做特定情况的练习题。高中以上的教科书基本都有这个毛病，最严重的就是外国翻译过来的所谓经典教科书，没有一个适合入门，《计算机网络》除外。 . 正因为市场上的书籍很多都有这个毛病，所以目前产生了新的读书法，具体可看我的学习方法下的文章，总的说来就是找到这本书自顶向下的结构，然后按照这个顺序看。 . 最让我惊喜的是这本书的结构，真的是自顶向下，由有宏观到微观，从战略到战术的排版结构，想不到这本在2000年出版的书能有如此觉悟，直接吊打现在的很多畅销书。 . 《金字塔思维 - 现代人精神健康指导》的序讲作者的意图和书与众不同的地方；前言说明这本书想告诉读者的内容；书内容第一部分总论健康思维，从精神世界的重要性到寻找精神框架，从超越对抗到顺应天人再到探索命运，层层递进，环环相扣，逻辑严密，思维敏捷。读此书时，好像看一局棋，先把握盘面局势，了解整体布局，再看整体流程，了解发展趋势，然后层层拆解，知晓孰轻孰重，最后细看局部，探索其中玄机。正如此书所言： . 当一个人有了这种智慧，便能清晰地把握人生的道路，既不会盲目羡慕那些不属于自己可走的路，也不会对自己慎重选择的道路产生后悔。由此，你便能构筑稳固的精神框架，经得起各种人生的困境和考验。这就是现代精神健康的灵魂。 . 内容 . 内容的话我只能用形象生动，通俗易懂来形容，用书中序的话来说就是“以他深厚的理论功力，进入那极其纷乱繁杂千变万化的真实世界，以轻松自然的自然语言，引人入胜的中外历史典故，生动活泼的生活例子，道出他在抽象深奥的哲学理论领域多年探索的结晶。” . 关于书中的具体内容这里不再赘述，感兴趣的可以前往图书馆借阅，网上只有二手书卖。书中的一些感悟我可能会在后面的博文中写出来，不过不要抱太大希望，因为那意味着我得有时间看第二遍。 . 缺点 . 一本书不可能只有优点没有缺点，上面说了这本书这么多好的地方，下面谈谈我认为的不足之处。 . 首先将思维的肯定要受到历史和时代的影响，有其局限性，但是令我惊讶的是里面有些思想已经突破那个时代，对近年来一些社会问题和现象具有很强的指导意义，这是让我十分惊喜的，但是书中有部分内容对当今这个社会已经不太适用，需要读者警惕，不要一味按照书中的来，毕竟当时的作者肯定没有料到当今的移动互联网时代，更没有料到互联网对人生的重要影响。 . 然后就是这本书更像一味药而不是保健手册，多放下而少争取，多治疗而少预防，如果我们的思维本身就是比较健康的，那么看这本书就需要警惕，“是药三分毒。” . 还有个缺点就是这本书有不少错别字。 . 其他 . 这段时间还在看《自控力是训练出来的》，对比起来差距明显。《自控力》这本书看了后收获还是有，不过明显看出作者对书的设计规划思考不够。书中疯狂列出忠告啊建议啊，根本不考虑读者怎么吸收这些东西，如果是我设计《自控力是训练出来的》，我肯定写成一本训练指南。 .",

            "content": "计算机网络： IPv6 简述 . IPv6 作为替代 IPv4 的协议，目前正在全球高速普及，它以近乎无穷的 IP 地址数和简单高效的结构被全球各大互联网企业推广。 . ##IPv6 来源 开发 IPv6 的起因是因为 IPv4 不够用了，我们知道 IPv4 的 IP 地址长度为 32bit，因此最多有 2^32 种，而且在 2011 年的时候 IPv4 已经被分配完了。目前已经无法申请获得新的 IPv4 的地址了，基于此原因，IPv6 应运而生。 . IPv6 与 IPv4 . 下面是一些 IPv6 与 IPv4 的对比。 . 描述 IPv4 IPv6 . 地址长度 | 32位 | 128位 | . 地址数 | 2^10 | 2^128 | . IP 报头 | 20~60可变长度 | 40固定长度 | . 分片/重组 | 由发送方（主机或路由器）对其分段，以适应要传输的下一链路 | 只能在源节点进行分段，且只能在目标节点完成重新装配。 | . 从上面的对比可以看出，IPv6 占用的空间更大，其可用数目也更多，而且它固定长度的报头和分片重组策略能加快数据包的处理。 . IPv4 迁移到 IPv6 . 虽然 IPv6 有诸多好处，但是目前整个互联网基本上是基于 IPv4 的，而且 IP 就像房子的基石一样，稍有不慎整栋大楼就会崩塌，所以目前 IPv6 的推广主要以下面两种形式展开。 . 双栈 . 这是目前最常用方法，使用该方法的 IPv6 结点还具有完整的 IPv4 实现，在于 IPv4 结点互操作时，使用 IPv4 数据报，与 IPv6 结点则使用 IPv6数据报。因此它同时具有 IPv6 和 IPv4 两种地址。 需要注意的是，如果发送方或接收方中任意一个（包括传输路径上的）仅支持 IPv4，则必须使用 IPv4 数据报。如下图，从 A 发往 F 只能用 IPv6，其原因是 IPv6 在转换成 IPv4 时一些特定字段会丢失。 . 隧道 . 这是前几年常用的方法。 但是建隧道这个方法解决了上面双栈面临的问题。假定两个 IPv6 结点中间经过 IPv4 路由器，如上图的 B 和 E，则把中间的 IPv4 路由器的集合当成隧道。在隧道发送端的 IPv6 结点可将整个 IPv6 数据报放到一个 IPv4 数据报的数据字段中。隧道接收端的 IPv6 结点最终收到该 IPv4 数据报，在确定了数据报中含有 IPv6 数据报后，从中取出 IPv6 数据报，再为该 IPv6 数据报提供路由，如下如所示： .",

            "title": "计算机网络：分组交换和电路交换简述",
            "content": "计算机网络：分组交换和电路交换简述 . 最近在看《计算机网络》，从中选取了自己比较感兴趣的部分写下了自己的理解。 . . 分组交换和电路交换用于互联网中网络链路和交换机移动数据的方法。形象来说就是家里面路由器和公司里交换机传输网络数据的方法，他将电脑中的数据向互联网传输，接收互联网的数据并发往电脑。 . ##分组交换 分组交换简单说来就是数据先暂存到路由器中，待要发送的数据全部到位后，再发往网络。 我们可以假设一个数据包有多个比特组成。路由器接收数据是一个比特一个比特接收，而发送则是以数据包形式完整发送，所以在路由器没有收到完整数据包之前，它是会把之前接收到的数据暂存在路由器中，这个也叫存储转发传输。 我们可以把路由器当做车站，而每一个数据包当做大巴，每一个比特当做旅客。当一辆大巴上的旅客都到齐的时候，大巴就发车。 . ###排队时延和分组丢失 排队时延顾名思义，就是在排队的时候会有时间损耗。在这里的时延主要是指大巴等人的时间消耗和大巴在路上堵车的时间消耗。 大巴等人指的是路由器的转发存储机制，必须等整个分组收齐后再发送出去，等待的过程中会耗费不少时间。而堵车指的是路由器通过链路发送数据，数据在发送之前会检查该链路是否有其他数据正在发送，如果被占用的话则需等待，这也是消耗时间的。 . 分组丢失指的是车站的容量是有限度的，如果人数超过车站容量，自然有些人就上不了车，此时就发生分组丢失。数据在等待的过程中如果仍有数据源源不断地进入，此时就可能超出路由器的最大存储范围，就会发生数据丢失。 . ###转发表和路由选择协议 前文中提到的链路指的是本地和远程建立的数据交换通道。一台路由器不止一条链路，它可能同时与多个远程服务器建立连接。因此数据在发送的过程中就会选择相应的链路发送出去。 每一个将要发送的数据都会包含对方服务器的 IP 地址，而每台路由器都用一个转发表，负责将目的地址映射成输出链路。并且这个选路过程很奇特，不是一次性将选路的结果全部告诉你，而是只告诉前往下一个站点的路，到了下一个站点将会再次查找，在通往下一个站点。类似于司机问路，到下一个路口再问行人。 . 路径选择协议就是自动设置转发表的协议，可以达到使数据走最短路径的效果。 . ##电路交换 电路交换简单来说就是建立专属通道，数据来了直接发送，无需排队。 说实话我是看到这里居然有信号课的频分复用和时分复用才决定写这篇博文的。 . 由于是建立了专属通道，形象来就可以类比于铁轨，但是一条铁轨只能承载一种车型，其他的车不能行驶这条铁轨，因此降低了数据堵塞的可能。 . ###复用 采用频分复用和时分复用技术建立专属通道。 频分复用是指划分不同频段建立专属通道，比如频率为 0~4kHz 的用于通电话，频率为 4kHz~50kHz 用于上行通道，频率为 50kHz~1MHz 的用于下行通道。收音机调频收听广播也是用的这个原理，不同频率对应不同的广播台。 时分复用就是利用时间作为划分，不同的时间段对应不同的通道，比如每晚7点就是中央电视台的专属通道。7点35分就是天气预报专属时间。 . ##分组交换和电路交换的对比 分组交换由于有排队时延和分组丢失，因此他并不适合实时服务。但是由于不需要建立专属通道，因此它的复杂度更低，对资源（主要是带宽）的需求也更低。 由于人们往往不会在同一时间要求上网，而是在不同时间段联网，因此对于电路交换来说，大部分的时间专属通道都是闲置的，而分组交换则充分利用了带宽。所以对于同样的带宽大小，分组交换能容纳更多的用户。 对于现在数百个家庭共享同一个光纤的情况，我们可以看出目前越来越多采用分组交换的方式发展。 .",

RLC 层主要负责对不同数据采用相适应的协议发送和解析，可靠的协议传输慢，传输快的数据可靠性不高，RLC 就是对这些数据分配不同协议的。 RLC 传输有三种模式，分别是透明模式（TM），非确认模式（UM）和确认模式（AM）。 . 透明模式 . 这个最简单了，来什么我发送什么，不作任何处理，速度最快，但是没有任何数据的重复传输和丢失检测。 . 非确认模式 . 发送端会对将要发送的数据进行分级重组，以便让每一个分组得到最大利用，同时添加了数据的顺序。 接收端会对数据进行重排序，去除重复接收的并把数据按发送端的发送数据排好。然后再把数据交由上层处理。 该模式速度相对于透明模式慢了不少，但是数据有了顺序并且避免了重复接收。但是由于是单项通讯，不可避免数据丢失。 . 确认模式 . 发送端不仅将新数据进行分级重组发送，还会接收接收端的消息。也就是说，发送端和接收端会双向通讯。发送端会主动发送询问接收端没有收到相应的数据，如果没有发送端会重新发送数据。 接收端不仅要完成数据的去重复和排序，还要向发送段发送是否丢失数据，接收发送端发来的重传数据。 . 想要更深入了解直接看协议文档吧。我画了一个思维导图，估计有帮助大家理解。 .",

            "title": "Vim: 编码问题",
            "content": "Vim: 编码问题 . Vim 的编码问题可以说是玄学问题，它总在我们最意想不到的时候出现。 Vim 中有四个设置与 Vim 编码相关，清楚这四个选项有助于处理编码问题。但是相信我，有的时候你就算搞清楚了这四个设置，在面临编码问题的时候依然会手足足措，特别是中文方面。 . . encoding . encoding 是 Vim 内部使用的字符编码方式。Vim 在工作的时候，如果编码方式与它的内部编码不一致，它会先把编码转换成内部编码。如果工作用的编码中含有无法转换为内部编码的字符，在这些字符就会丢失。因此，在选择 Vim 的内部编码的时候，一定要使用一种表现能力足够强的编码，以免影响正常工作。 . 由于 encoding 选项涉及到 Vim 中所有字符的内部表示，因此只能在 Vim 启动的时候设置一次。在 Vim 工作过程中修改 encoding 会造成非常多的问题。一般将encoding设置成 utf-8。 . termencoding . termencoding 是 Vim 用于屏幕显示的编码，在显示的时候，Vim 会把内部编码转换为屏幕编码，再用于输出。内部编码中含有无法转换为屏幕编码的字符时，该字符会变成问号，但不会影响对它的编辑操作。如果 termencoding 没有设置，则直接使用 encoding 不进行转换。 . fileencoding . 当 Vim 从磁盘上读取文件的时候，会对文件的编码进行探测。如果文件的编码方式和 Vim 的内部编码方式不同，Vim 就会对编码进行转换。转换完毕后，Vim 会将 fileencoding 选项设置为文件的编码。当 Vim 存盘的时候，如果 encoding 和 fileencoding 不一样，Vim 就会进行编码转换。因此，通过打开文件后设置 fileencoding，我们可以将文件由一种编码转换为另一种编码。但是，由前面的介绍可以看出，fileencoding 是在打开文件的时候，由 Vim 进行探测后自动设置的。因此，如果出现乱码，我们无法通过在打开文件后重新设置 fileencoding 来纠正乱码。 . fileencodings . 编码的自动识别是通过设置 fileencodings 实现的，注意是复数形式。fileencodings 是一个用逗号分隔的列表，列表中的每一项是一种编码的名称。当我们打开文件的时候，Vim 按顺序使用 fileencodings 中的编码进行尝试解码，如果成功的话，就使用该编码方式进行解码，并将 fileencoding 设置为这个值，如果失败的话，就继续试验下一个编码。 . 因此，我们在设置 fileencodings 的时候，一定要把要求严格的、当文件不是这个编码的时候更容易出现解码失败的编码方式放在前面，把宽松的编码方式放在后面。 . 例如，latin1 是一种非常宽松的编码方式，任何一种编码方式得到的文本，用 latin1 进行解码，都不会发生解码失败。当然，解码得到的结果自然也就是理所当然的“乱码”。因此，如果你把 latin1 放到了 fileencodings 的第一位的话，打开任何中文文件都是乱码也就是理所当然的了。一般用如下设置： . set fileencodings=ucs-bom,utf-8,cp936,gb18030,big5,euc-jp,euc-kr,latin1 .",

[MentoHUST] Username=校园网 Password=登录密码 Nic=eth0.2 #这个具体看网卡 IP=0.0.0.0 Mask=0.0.0.0 Gateway=0.0.0.0 DNS=0.0.0.0 PingHost=0.0.0.0 Timeout=8 EchoInterval=30 RestartWait=15 MaxFail=8 StartMode=0 DhcpMode=2 DaemonMode=2 ShowNotify=0 Version=0.00 DataFile=/etc/mentohust/ dhcpscript=nil . 再启动 mentohust 就可以登录校园网了。 . mentohust 开机启动 在 /etc/init.d/ 新建 mentohust 文件，内容为 . #!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common # /init.d/mentohust START=99 STOP=10 start() { /root/mentohust } stop() { /root/mentohust -k &amp; } restart() { stop start } . 保存并修改文件权限为755 建立软连接 . ln -s /etc/init.d/mentohust /etc/rc.d/S99mentohust . ##配置IPv6 由于华科是认证后才有的 IPv6 地址，因此设置不像无需认证的简单。 虽然IPv6不倡导一种用 NAT 内网转发，但是在华科我还没见到用其他方法能行的。 . 大家参考这篇文章即可，写的很详细。 . 后面是这篇博客的本地实现版。 . 下面的是在路由器 web 中实现的方法，ssh后台登录配置也可以实现。 . . 在系统-&gt;网络中搜索 ip6tables、kmod-ipt-nat6这两个包，如果没有安装，则搜索安装。 . . 网络-&gt;接口：清空IPv6 ULA-Prefix一栏，保存&amp;应用。 . 这会删除 /etc/config/network 中 config globals &#39;globals&#39; 下的 option ula_prefix 条目 . . 网络-&gt;接口-&gt;WAN：设置你的IPv4外网接口参数。华科童鞋不用MAC绑定不用管。 WAN口其他参数依据你的网络配置。 保存&amp;应用 . . 网络-&gt;接口-&gt;WAN6：设置你的IPv6外网接口参数。 . 去掉“使用端局通告的DNS服务器”，填入学校的支持IPv6的DNS服务器，或者用下面的DNS服务器： . Google：2001:4860:4860::8888      2001:4860:4860::8844 HE.net DNS：2001:470:20::2 OpenDNS：2620:0:ccc::2      2620:0:ccd::2 . 保存&amp;应用 . 这会在 /etc/config/network 中 config interface &#39;wan6&#39; 下添加 option dns &#39;2001:4860:4860::8844 2620:0:ccd::2 2001:470:20::2&#39; 条目 . . 网络-&gt;接口-&gt;LAN，禁用 IPv6 assignment length（让 odhcpd 分配 IPv6 地址） . IPv6地址填写：AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD::1/64（这个内网地址可以随便改A:B:C:D::1/64也行） . IPv6 Routed Prefix：AAAA:BBBB:CCCC:DDDD::/64（上边的地址去掉末尾的1） . 这会在 /etc/config/network 中 config interface &#39;lan&#39; 下添加 option ip6addr &#39;aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd::1/64&#39;  和 option ip6prefix &#39;aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd::/64&#39; 条目 . . 勾选下方Always announce default Router . 这会在 /etc/config/dhcp 中 config dhcp &#39;lan&#39; 下添加 option ra_default &#39;1&#39; 条目 DHCPv6-Mode 改为 Stateful-only（关闭内网 SLAAC，简化网络，此项可以不做） . 这会在 /etc/config/dhcp 中 config dhcp &#39;lan&#39; 下 修改 option ra_management 参数为’2’ . 保存&amp;应用 . . . 网络-&gt;防火墙-&gt;通信规则：取消最后一项 Allow-ICMPv6-Forward 的勾选。避免不必要的ICMPv6转发。 . 保存&amp;应用 这会在 /etc/config/firewall 中 Allow-ICMPv6-Forward 规则下添加 option enabled &#39;0&#39; 条目 . 系统-&gt;启动项：填写修改后的启动脚本，本文最后贴出。该脚本负责添加 NAT 的防火墙伪装和 IPv6路由表。 提交。 . 脚本会被写入到/etc/rc.local中 . 注意：此脚本开机尝试99次获取wan口IPv6地址，若失败则不再添加IPv6路由表。 . . 点此测试你的IPv6配置 . 启动脚本： . #!/bin/sh /etc/rc.common # NAT6 init script for OpenWrt // Depends on package: kmod-ipt-nat6 ip6tables tracepath6  # Ref:  https://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/ipv6.nat6 MAX_TRIES=99 WAN6_NAME=&quot;wan6&quot; #eth0.2 by default WAN6_INTERFACE=$(uci get &quot;network.$WAN6_NAME.ifname&quot;) #e.g. aaaa:bbbb:cccc:dddd::/64 LAN_IP6PREFIX=$(uci get network.lan.ip6prefix) #e.g. ddc2:d512:65f5::/48 #LAN_ULA_PREFIX=$(uci get network.globals.ula_prefix) PROBE=0 COUNT=1 while [ $PROBE -eq 0 ]         do         if [ $COUNT -gt $MAX_TRIES ]         then             logger -t NAT6 &quot;No IPv6 route found (reached retry limit $MAX_TRIES times)&quot; &amp;&amp; exit 1         fi         sleep 5         logger -t NAT6 &quot;Probing IPv6 route ($COUNT time)&quot;         COUNT=$((COUNT+1))         PROBE=$(route -A inet6 | grep -c &#39;::/0&#39;) done #ip6tables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -s &quot;$LAN_ULA_PREFIX&quot; -o &quot;$WAN6_INTERFACE&quot; -j MASQUERADE ip6tables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -s &quot;$LAN_IP6PREFIX&quot; -o &quot;$WAN6_INTERFACE&quot; -j MASQUERADE #WAN6_GATEWAY=$(route -A inet6 -e | grep &quot;$WAN6_INTERFACE&quot; | awk &#39;/:: /0/{print $2; exit}&#39; #get gateway from routing table.  !!!Caution!!!

            "content": "《番茄工作法图解》读书感悟 . 花了一个小时看完，写一下自己的感受。 番茄工作法简单易上手，很容易改善目前的生活。但是如果还想往上达到一个新高度，就需要深入了解番茄工作法。 . ##第一阶段 关键词： 25min，5min，专心 . 无需多阐释，这时番茄工作法易上手的根本原因，实施起来极简单。 . ##第二阶段 关键词：最重要，一次一个，每天计划，预估，马上停止，回顾番茄，防止打断，计划外紧急，新番茄计划。 . 这部分需要做一下说明：每次番茄都要完成当前最紧急的事情，这样让让你全心全意投入进去，而不会分心想我还有**没有完成。 一个番茄完成只完成一件事情，因为切换工作会造成大脑中断，大脑切换到另一个工作是需要时间的，在短短的25min内切换工作是无法达到高效学习的目的。还有这样的好处是留有时间过度学习，过度学习将在第三阶段阐述。 每天早上计划今天的任务，不要太多，完不成计划没有意义，一天能达到8个番茄就已经很好了，每天制定一定数量的番茄并坚持每天完成。长期下来会越来越有成就感，拥有好的状态。 既然有计划就有预估，判断每个任务的番茄数是关键。因为一天很少超过8个番茄，因此一个任务最好不要超过7个番茄，学会细分任务。合理的预估是保证能按时完成番茄的关键。 正如在番茄时间不能中断，到了休息时间应该马上停止。如果担心思路中断，可以先做个标记。马上停止手上工作开始休息的理由是保证下个番茄的高效进行，人长时间高精力的工作是会折寿的。 每天晚上需要回顾今天的番茄，对计划和预估做适当评价，看看有没有什么不合适的，有没有什么新发现，有没有哪里做的很好的。保证未来的番茄能够高效进行。 正如一个番茄只做一件事一样，为了保证番茄钟内高效工作，我们要尽量防止自己的番茄钟被内部或外部因素打断。让大脑处于高速运行状态。 如果遇到十分重要的事情，可以先把这件事记下来，接着进行当前的番茄钟。等番茄钟结束后再规划新的番茄来完成这个重要的事情。切忌在休息时间内完成重要事情。 如果遇到必须要打断的事情，那么当前的番茄钟作废。 . ##第三阶段 关键词：条件反射，回顾收获，连续工作，过度学习，合理休息。 . 正如我们闻到香味会流口水一样，让自己关于番茄钟形成一定的条件反射有助于自己高效工作。如在番茄开始时播放时钟滴答声，或者重复一些相同动作。长期以往后，每次在进行这些动作时，大脑就会高速运转并集中精力。 每天总结时告诉自己今天收获了什么，按照记忆曲线规律，帮助自己收获今天有价值的东西，能快速帮助自己提高。 不要让休息时间太长，避免每次开始番茄时都像从头开始一样，最好多个番茄排在一起，这样能保证工作持续高效进行。 番茄钟还没结束但任务已经完成了，这时候切换到其他任务没有意义。不如对刚刚完成的任务进行总结反思，有时候会有意想不到的收获。 为了保证番茄钟内能高效工作，休息时间一定要休息。离开位置走一走，趴在桌上休息会儿，让脑袋尽量放空，少思考。 .",

            "content": "#ssh 远程连接 从最易上手的开始讲，比如我们想连接一个服务器，服务器IP地址是192.168.1.1，账号username，那么我们输入如下两个命令中的一个命令即可 . ssh username@192.168.1.1 ssh -l username 192.168.1.1 . 如果远程服务器指定了端口，我们只需添加-p命令即可 例如登陆极路由后台（抱歉打了软广） . ssh root@192.168.199.1 -p 1022 . 以root身份登录到IP为192.168.199.1的服务器中，连接端口为1022 . 查看SSH客户端版本 . 使用ssh -V命令可以得到版本号。需要注意的是，Linux和macOS一般自带的是OpenSSH。下面的例子即表明该系统正在使用OpenSSH： . $ ssh -V OpenSSH_7.3p1, LibreSSL 2.4.1 . 查看服务器是否安装sshserver . 有些时候我们无法用ssh 连接远程服务器，原因可能是服务器上并没有安装ssh服务端，特别是用最小安装包安装系统时，一般都没有安装ssh服务端。 . 在服务器终端输入 . ssh localhost . 如果出现下面信息则没有安装sshserver . ssh: connect to hostlocalhost port 22: Connection refused . ##安装sshserver ubuntu: . sudo apt-get install openssh-server . 安装完成后启动服务 . service ssh start . 用SSH登录到远程主机 . 当你第一次使用ssh登录远程主机时，会出现没有找到主机密钥的提示信息。输入”yes”后，系统会将远程主机的密钥加入到你的主目录下的 .ssh/know_hosts下，这样你就可以继续操作了。 当你第二次登陆远程主机时，只需要你输入远程主机的登录密码即可。 . ##ssh无密码登入 . 事实再一次证明英文帮助文档常常把一个简单的功能解释的又臭又长 . 该方面目前适用于macOS 10.12以后的版本！！！ | . 使用命令生成ssh登录的公钥和密钥 . ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;uesrname@remotehost&quot; . 接下来按照提示完成想要的设置 执行命令将密钥添加到Mac的keychain，其中id-rsa是你生成的密钥地址 . ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa ssh-add -A . 编辑配置文件，在~/.ssh/config中添加如下命令 . Host * AddKeysToAgent yes UseKeychain yes IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa . 用SSH退出符切换SSH会话 . 这个技巧非常实用。尤其是远程登陆到一台主机A，然后从A登陆到B，如果希望在A上做一些操作，还得再开一个终端，很是麻烦。 当你使用ssh从本机登录到远程主机时，你可能希望切换到本地做一些操作，然后再重新回到远程主机。这个时候，你不需要中断ssh连接，只需要按照如下步骤操作即可： 当你已经登录到了远程主机时，你可能想要回到本地主机进行一些操作，然后又继续回到远程主机。在这种情况下，没有必要断开远程主机的会话，你可以用下面的办法来完成： . 登入远程主机： . localhost$ ssh -l username remotehost 已连接远程主机： remotehost$ 要临时回到本地主机，输入退出符号：`~`与`Control-Z`组合。 当你输入`~`你不会立即在屏幕上看到，当你按下`Control-Z`并且按回车之后才一起显示。如下，在远程主机中以此输入`~&lt;Control-Z&gt;` remotehost$ ~^Z [1]+ Stopped ssh -l username remotehost localhost$ . 现在你已经退回到了本地主机，ssh远程客户端会话就在UNIX后台中运行，你可以向下面那样查看它： . localhost$ jobs [1]+ Stopped ssh -l username remotehost 你可以将后台运行的ssh会话进程切换到前台，重新回到远程主机，而无需输入密码 localhost$ fg %1 ssh -l username remotehost remotehost$ .",

取消第二个单声道，令其静音，使第一个通道成为唯一的采访谈话音源 . 关键帧范围选择： 使用范围选择工具（r键），在片段上选择某一区间，拖动控制线，这时系统会自动设定4个关键帧 . 片段浏览： 显示-片段浏览命令激活 激活后可以单独查看片段，没有上下片段和音频的混合干扰 . ###平衡颜色 ####自动白平衡 . 选择某一片段，单击视频画面检查器的魔术棒图标，会显示平衡颜色 | 单击平衡颜色，Final Cut Pro 会优化那帧画面，但整个片段并没有被分析 | ####手动调节片段曝光 只有片段被剪辑到项目中后，才能控制颜色调整参数 . 选择需要修改的在时间线上的片段，单击视频检查器中的魔术棒，选中显示颜色版 | 在“显示”选项卡中，单击”在检视器中显示“-视频观测仪 | 为方便调整，建议关闭浏览器 | 首先调整对比度，在视频观测仪中选择“显示”下面的一个小图标，选择“波形”和“RGB列示图“。 | 对比度第一步先调整像素亮度，在右边的“颜色板”中选择“曝光”标签，有四个可以调节的选项，从左到右分别是全局-阴影-中间调-高光，调整是注意要让所有亮度在0～100范围内 | 亮度调好后切换到“颜色”标签。 | ####手动调节片段色彩 1.在颜色版中选中颜色标签 . 四个圆球代表全局-阴影-中间调-高光，都位于一个方格上，方格上半部带有“+”号，为增加该颜色数值，方格下半部带有“-”号，为减少该颜色数值。在调整之前现在视频观测仪中调整到矢量显示器。 | 如果图像完全没有偏色问题，观测仪中所有代表像素的点会集中在中央。 | 观测仪中图像偏向哪种颜色，就在颜色版中将四个圆球拖向该颜色区域的下半部分 | 若调整过度，可单击还原按钮重新调整 | ####匹配颜色 为了在不同画面维持一致画面感觉，需要匹配颜色 . 选择需要调整的片段，按住option键单击该片段，在选中该片段的同时播放头也对准该片段 | 在检视器中选择魔术棒图标，单击”匹配颜色“，检视器此时会分成左右两个画面，左为原片段，右为需要调整的片段。 | 扫视到需要匹配的画面后，单击一下，右侧片段会更新匹配，效果满意后，单击“应用匹配项”。 | ##共享文件 ###捆绑包 将影片同时发布到多个位置。 打开Final Cut Pro偏好设置，选择“目的位置“-“添加目的位置”，将捆绑包拖入左侧边栏中，将需要的预置项目拖到捆绑包中，并给捆绑包重新命名 . ##导入文件 ###引用外部媒体 引用外部媒体的意思是让源文件保留在原位，Final Cut Pro会创建一系列替身文件指向源文件 . 创建好资源库和事件后，打开导入媒体窗口，选择指定片段后在右边选择“让文件保留在原位”，单击导入按钮 . 若遇到丢失文件状态，只需选择离线片段，“文件”-“重新链接文件”即可 | . ###文件拷贝进资源库 将原媒体文件直接内置于Final Cut Pro . 创建好资源库和事件后，打开导入媒体窗口，选择指定片段后在右边选择“拷贝到资源库”，单击导入按钮 . ###资源库内部拖动文件 将事件1中的视频移到事件2中只需鼠标拖动过去 将事件1中的视频复制到事件2中时，拖动的同时按住option键 . ###制作便携资源库 . 新建一个空的资源库，如“On the Go” | 选中要转移的事件，选择”将事件拷贝到资源库”-“On the Go” | 取消选择“优化的媒体”和“代理媒体”，选择“好“ | 选择该资源库”On the Go“，菜单栏中选择“文件”-“整合资源库文件” | 单击“好” | 关闭资源库 | ##双系统录制同步 有时会在不同设备上录制视频和音频，这时候需要将它们同步组合成一个新片段 . 选择视频和相对应的音频，右键选择“同步片段”命令，这时候会生成一个新的片段，在该资源库中。但此时该片段同时播放了视频中的音频和单独录制的音频，需要调整。 右键该同步片段，选择“在时间线中打开”，目前有两个方法关闭视频中的音频 . 将视频片段中的音量控制线向下拖到无限小 | 在音频检查器中取消“故事情节”选项 | . ##颜色抠像 选中需要抠像的片段，在效果浏览器中选择“抠像”-“抠像器”，双击应用效果。 对于被去掉的背景，还需要在该片段下方添加相应其他背景填充 利用遮罩工具，去掉其他的一些元素 . 若想手动选择样本颜色，则在视频检查器中将抠像器参数中的“强度”滑块拖到0% 找到“精炼抠像”中的样本颜色按钮，将光标移动到监视器上，在背景上拖出一个矩形框，去除背景 反复执行上一步骤，直到所有背景都消失 .

MathStudio作为iOS上最为强大的数学神器之一，以其丑陋的外表将许多人拒之墙外。本文参考网上《Math Studio中文教程——内置函数全翻译》和MathStudio官方教程，并融入个人经验 . 本文以MathStudio Express为例，MathStudio上的操作方法大致相似，如果读者想深入研究MathStudio，欢迎访问官网 . ##基本操作 当你第一次打开时，MathStudio会教你一些基本操作，这里不说明。 另外，在App顶部的Menu菜单中有Tutorials选项，对一些常用功能做了些讲解。 .     . 基础 | 解方程 | . 极限 | 求导 | . 积分 | 2D画图 | . 3D画图 | 矩阵 | . 自定义函数 | 脚本 | . 滑块 |   | . 如果你想尽快装逼，建议查看Menu中的Demos选项，里面内置了很多吊炸天的演示 . ###基础 跳过，这个系统计算器就可以胜任 ###解方程 . x^2=9 Solve(x^2+y^2=9,x) Solve(6,13,5) . 第一行表示可以解简单方程 第二行表示可以解带参数的方程，Solve()中第一个参数填方程，后面的参数填你要求解的变量 第三行是解一元二次方程的简便表达方式，个人测试这种表示法只支持一元二次方程 . Solve(x+y+z=5,x+2y=6,z-x=3) Solve(x^2+y^2=25, y^2=x^2+3) Solve(3sin(x)+exp(x)=2,x,[-2π,2π]) . 前两行表示可以求解多元多次方程 最后一行第三个参数表示约束了x的范围 ###求极限 . Limit((3-3tan(x))/(sin(x)-cos(x)),x,π/4) Limit(-1/x,x,0) Limit(n!/n^n,n,∞) Limit(cos(a*x)/x^2 - cos(b*x)/x^2,x,0) . 极限函数 Limit() 中第一个参数填表达式，第二个填变量，第三个填趋近的值 除了简单的求极限运算，我们可以看出这个函数支持无穷∞运算，带参数求极限 . ###求导 . D(x^6+3x,x) D(f(x),x) D(exp(-s*t),t) D(f(x)*g(x),x) D(a^(x^2),x) D(sin(3x+6),x,3) . 第一二行表示可以求导具体和抽象的方程 第三行表示可以求导带参数的方程 四五行表示可以按链式法则求解 最后一行最后一个参数表示求导次数，这里是连续求导三次 . ###积分 . ∫(sin(x)^2) ∫(x^2+y^2,x) ∫(1/(x^4+4),x) ∫(ln(x+1)^2*x,x,u=x+1) ∫(asin(sqrt(x)),x,u=sqrt(x),1) . ∫ 与 Integrate()函数等价 可以积分带参数的方程 第四行表示用x+1的形式表达积分结果，相当于用u替换x表达结果 最后一行的最后一个参数1我不知道什么意思，不过结果很炫酷！ . ###2D画图 . sin(x) sin(4𝛉) sin(4𝛉+T) [y,-x] [sin(x),cos(x)] . 第一行在输入框中输入完表达式后需要按键盘上面的Plot按钮 第二三行在输入表达式后需要按键盘上的Polar按钮（在数字键盘的上方的上方，需要滑动两次），显示为极坐标 第三行实现方法跟第二行一样 第四行在输入表达式后需要按键盘上的Vector按钮，显示为矩阵向量 第五行在输入表达式后按Plot按钮，显示为在笛卡尔坐标上同时显示两个函数图像 . ###3D画图 . cos(x+T)*sin(y+T) . 输入完成后按Plot按钮 . ###矩阵 . a=[[1,2],[3,4]] a(1) a(1,2) . 创建了一个2*2的矩阵，并赋值给a 显示a的第一行 显示a[1,2]的值，这里可以用数组的概念去理解 . ###函数 . f(x,y)=x^2+y^2 f(2,3) . 创建一个自定义函数 求特定的值 . ###脚本 . 这里需要图片说明，首先按下Script键 这里的脚本其实相当于更强大的函数，Name后填函数名称，Parameters后填变量，之后可以直接用了，想当年我的物理实验数据就是这样求出来的。 . ###滑块 . 本人觉得最好玩的功能，先按Slider按钮 底下的1……..a那行是可以拖动的，蓝色的是个滑块，由Slider定义，a为变量名，1为滑块最小值，10为滑块最大值，0.1为最小移动单位。 . ##深入了解 限于个人水平，在这个标题下仅做一些个人能力之内的事情 要想用好 MathStudio 需要经常查询Manual，里面给出了所有函数的具体使用方法 ###矩阵相关 ####matrix . matrix(3) matrix(2,3) matrix(2,6)+2 . 创建一个3*3的空矩阵 创建一个2*3的矩阵 创建一个2*6的矩阵并全部赋值为2 ##其他用法 . ###单位换算 这个功能不知道为什么在我的设备上无法运行，不过我宁愿用Siri也不会用这个功能 就贴几个官方的示意图 英里与千米换算 . 3@miles-&gt;@kilometers . 升与加仑换算 . 10@liters -&gt; @gallons .",

            "title": "KMP 算法",
            "content": "KMP 算法 . 参考资料 . 本文参考算法导论，清华大学出版社的数据结构C语言版，伯乐在线的我理解的KMP算法，matrix67大神的博客，再根据自己理解写下这篇文章 . 正文 . KMP算法是解决字符串匹配问题，详细来说，是当前有A，B两个字符串，KMP算法就是来判断B串是否是A串子串的高效算法。比如你可以委婉地问你的MM：“假如你要向你喜欢的人表白的话，我的名字是你的告白语中的子串吗？” 相对于朴素的时间复杂度为O(mn)的比较算法（虽然在大多是情况下只有O(m+n) 但在这里我们只考虑最坏情况）KMP算法稳定在O(m+n) ，因此有较广泛的应用。 KMP算法是我遇到的第一个看了算法导论和网上一些资料后还有些懵懂的算法，后来发现其实主要原因是我们上数据结构这门课时老师讲的不是很清楚，所以有些关键的东西一直没有弄清。 . 出于对Matrix67大神的崇拜，直接引用他的例子说事。当前有两个字符串A=”abababaababacb”，B=”ababacb”，首先看看朴素算法是怎么工作的。我们用两个指针i和j分别表示，A[i-j+ 1..i]与B[1..j]完全相等。刚开始我们先从i=j=1开始比较，当我们发现i=j=5时，A和B的下一个字符就不相等了。 . i = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 …… A = a b a b a b a a b a b … B = a b a b a c b j = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . 那么此时我们就要把i倒退回i=2，j倒退回j=1重新开始比较。 . i = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 …… A = a b a b a b a a b a b … B = a b a b a c b j = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . 因此当我们遇到像A= “aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaab”，B=”aaaaaaaab”这样的字符串时，传统朴素算法每次匹配错误后B串只前进一格的做法就显得很慢。 KMP算法高效解决了字符串匹配中不断回退的问题，也就是上面例子中i从5倒退回2的问题。KMP算法的想法是相对于之前一次匹配不成功子串前进一格，能不能子串一次前进多个格子。在提出解决方案前，我们首先引入一些概念： . 部分匹配表 . 下面这个是“ababacb”这个模板的部分匹配表： . index: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . char: | a | b | a | b | a | c | b | . value: | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | . 如果我有一个7个字符的模板（这里我们就用“ababacb”来举例子），我的部分匹配表将会有7格。如果此时此刻我正匹配模板的第7格即最后一格，那意味着我匹配了整个模板（“ababacb”）；如果我正匹配模板的第6格，则意味着当前仅匹配了整个模板的前6位（“ababac”），此时第7位(“b”)是无关的，不用去管它；目前我还没有提到部分匹配表每格数据的含义，在这里仅仅是交代了大概。 . 现在，为了说明刚刚提到的每格数据的含义，我们首先要明白什么是最优前缀什么是最优后缀。 . 最优前缀 . 一个字符串中，去除一个或多个尾部的字符所得的新字符串就是最优前缀。例如 “S”、 “Sn”、 “Sna”、 “Snap”都是“Snape”的最优前缀。 . 最优后缀 . 一个字符串中，去除一个或多个首部的字符所得的新字符串就是最优后缀。例如“agrid”、 “grid”、“rid”、 “id”、“d”都是 “Hagrid”的最优后缀。 . 有了两个概念，我现在可以用一句话来概括部分匹配表里每列数据的含义了： . 模板（子模板）中，既是最优前缀也是最优后缀的最长字符串的长度。 . 下面我举例说明一下这句话。我们来看部分匹配表的第3格数据，如果你还记得我在前面提到的，这意味着我们目前仅仅关心前3个字母（“aba”）。在“aba”这个子模板中，有两个最优前缀（“a”和“ab”）和两个最优后缀（“a”和“ba”）。其中，最优前缀“ab”并不是最优后缀。因此，最优前缀与最优后缀中，相同的只有“a”。那么，此时此刻既是最优前缀也是最优后缀的最长字符串的长度就是1了。 . 我们再来试试第4格，我们应该是关注于前4个字母（“abab”）。可以看出，有3个最优前缀（“a”、“ab”、 “aba”）和3个最优后缀（“b”、“ab”、“bab”）。这一次 “ab” 既是最优前缀也是最优后缀，并且长度为2，因此，部分匹配表的第4格值为2。 . 这是很有趣的例子，我们再看看第5格的情况，也就是考虑“ababa”。我们有4个最优前缀（“a”、 “ab”、“aba”，和“abab”）和4个最优后缀（“a”、 “ba”、“aba”，和“baba”）。现在，有两个匹配“a”和“aba” 既是最优前缀也是最优后缀，而“aba”比“a”要长，所以部分匹配表的第5格值为3。 . 看看第6格的情况，不难看出，这两个集合之间不会有任何的交集。因为，所有最优后缀都以“c”结尾，但没有任何最优前缀是以“c”结尾的，所以没有相匹配的，因此第7格值为0。 . 当我们找到了部分匹配的字符串时，可以用部分匹配表里的值来跳过前面一些字符（而不是重复进行没有必要的比较）。具体是这样工作的： 当i=j=5时，i的值保持不变，j=3，然后继续比较。当i=7，j=5时发现下一组又不相等了，此时i保持不变，j=3，然后又开始比较。也就是说，i是不断增加的，随着i的增加j相应地变化，且j满足以A[i]结尾的长度为j的字符串正好匹配B串的前 j个字符（j当然越大越好）。那么如何得知j该等于多少呢，现在需要检验A[i+1]和B[j+1]的关系。当A[i+1]=B[j+1]时，i和j各加一；什么时候j=m了，我们就说B是A的子串（B串已经整完了），并且可以根据这时的i值算出匹配的位置。当A[i+1]!=B[j+1]，KMP的策略是调整j的位置（减小j值）使得A[i-j+1..i]与B[1..j]保持匹配且新的B[j+1]恰好与A[i+1]匹配（从而使得i和j能继续增加）。 . 我们看一看当 i=j=5时的情况。 . i = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 …… A = a b a b a b a a b a b … B = a b a b a c b j = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . 此时，A[6]!=B[6]。这表明，此时j不能等于5了，我们要把j改成比它小的值j’。j’可能是多少呢？仔细想一下，我们发现，j’必须要使得B[1..j]中的头j’个字母和末j’个字母完全相等（这样j变成了j’后才能继续保持i和j的性质）。这个j’当然要越大越好。而这恰好是部分匹配表的性质，即我们要找既是最优前缀又是最优后缀的最长字符串。在这里，B [1..5]=”ababa”，”aba”就是我们想要的，于是j=next[j]。而当新的j为3时，A[6]恰好和B[4]相等。于是，i变成了6，而j则变成了 4： . i = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 …… A = a b a b a b a a b a b … B = a b a b a c b j = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 . ps：代码不想写，上其他博客找吧。 .",
